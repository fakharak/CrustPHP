# CrustPHP
CrustPHP encapsulates Phalcon Micro ( ;a compiled HMVC-Architecture as PHP-Extension written in C++) inside Swoole ( ;a compiled PHP-Extension for Asynchronous Progamming Models) in oreer to build Concurrent Microservices.<br/><br/>

The Architectrue supports development of "Gartner's Event-broker model" through "Enterprise Service Bus" for "dynamic choreography" of Event-driven Microservices.<br/><br/>

CrustPHP allows rapid development and state-of-the-art choreography of Microservices.<br/><br/>

The framework is developed such that even a plain PHP Developer can master it and start delivering massive Microservices with in few hours.<br/><br/>
It also provides built-in User Management module with JWT Token.<br/><br/>

Future Integrations:
I aims to port AI/ML/Data Science libraries PHP-ML and Rubix-ML.
